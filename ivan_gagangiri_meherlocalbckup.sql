Recruiting may mean hiring an agency to find participants, but for testing WordPress, it makes more sense to recruit from within this community, so that means making a screening survey, reading all the responses, segmenting the respondents into categories and contacting people until you&#8217;ve filled your desired quotas (for whatever segments you&#8217;re seeking, such as newbie, experienced user, developer, CMS user, photoblogger, mobile user, etc. ).

When the sessions are complete, the results are analyzed. All the notes and videos are reviewed, patterns are identified, and ultimately a report is written and the feedback informs the next round of revisions.</p>\n<p>Some people think it shouldn&#8217;t take much time to do all this. I&#8217;ve lost count of the number of people who cite <a href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/20000319.html">an old article by Jakob Nielsen</a> that says you don&#8217;t need to test with more than 5 users because usability issues become clear right away. While I&#8217;ve found that to be generally true, when your user base is as diverse in experience level, usage, platform  configuration, language (right to left languages have a pretty different experience) and demography as the WordPress community is, 5 users really isn&#8217;t enough to get a clear picture.

I&#8217;ve been listening to a couple of WordPress podcasts recently (<a href="http://www.wptavern.com/wordpress-weekly">WordPress Weekly</a> and <a href="http://wordcastpodcast.com/">WordCast</a>, in particular), and there had been a lot of buzz about some of the <a href="http://central.wordcamp.org/">WordCamp</a> gatherings taking place in various locations.</p>\n<p>In particular, there were a few complaints that were pointed out (and some kudos, as well), and it got me thinking about things that event organizers might want to plan ahead for when getting ready for future WordCamps. Having been a speaker at <a href="http://birmingham.wordcamp.org/">WordCamp Birmingham</a> last year (and planning to do it again this fall), I&#8217;m pleased to say that <a href="http://dresramblings.com/">Andre Natta</a> and his cohorts did an excellent job with that event. Some of that was probably made easier by the fact that it was a relatively small WordCamp (I think it was about 60 attendees). The bigger the group, the harder the logistics.</p>\n<p>In addtition to WordCamp, I&#8217;ve also attended a couple of other technical gatherings, like CodeCamp and SoCon, so some of  what I&#8217;ll speak to are from first-hand experience. That said, what are some of the areas that an organizer should give particular attention to? Here is my completely unsolicited, backseat-driver&#8217;s list of event organizer dos and don&#8217;ts:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>WiFi and Bandwidth</strong>: Poor internet connectivity is probably one of the most frequent complaints heard at just about any technical conference. Try to do whatever possible to ensure that you have enough bandwidth to handle your group size. If there are special setup/login instructions, make sure you provide that information to every attendee when they check in. It&#8217;s frustrating to spend the first couple of sessions trying to figure out how to get online.</li>\n<li><strong>Streaming</strong>: If you can, identify and designate just one or two people ahead of time to handle live video/audio streaming (and perhaps a backup person). Gently remind attendees that if several people are uplinking to <a href="http://www.ustream.tv/">ustream</a> simultaneously, it&#8217;s going to kill the network connection for everybody. Also, try to reserve good seats for those handling the videography.</li>\n<li><strong>A/C Power Outlets</strong>: Just about everybody there is going to have a laptop, and will need to charge their battery at some point. If it can be arranged, ensure that there are power outlets available. You might want to procure a bunch of extension cords and multi-outlet power strips. If outlets are in short supply, try to encourage people not to &#8220;camp&#8221; on them for the whole event, and to let others have access. Label your cords so that folks know that they belong to you, and are less likely to wander off with them.</li>\n<li><strong>Food</strong>: Be prepared to offer lunch, coffee, soft drinks, water, and maybe snacks. Try to find a sponsor for the event who can provide these things. At WordCamp Birmingham 2008, Microsoft sponsored lunch, arranging a catered buffet with salad, cole slaw, and BBQ sandwiches from a local restaurant. However, I&#8217;ll also suggest that you try to have an option suitable for vegetarians, too (something more substantial than an iceberg lettuce salad).</li>\n<li><strong>Hashtags</strong>: Decide ahead of time what the &#8220;official&#8221; hashtag for your event should be, make it known, and encourage attendees to use that. Keep it as short as possible while remaining unambiguous. I don&#8217;t know how many times I&#8217;ve seen somebody on <a href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter</a> saying &#8220;What&#8217;s the hashtag for the Dallas XYZ Conference? Is it #xyzconf, #xyz09, #xyzconf09, #dallasxyz, #xyzdfw09, or what?&#8221; Also, remind folks to use the hashtag when uploading photos to <a href="http://flickr.com/">Flickr</a>, and while you&#8217;re at it, go ahead and set up a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/">Flickr Group</a> for everyone to submit their photos to.</li>\n<li><strong>Adapters</strong>: You are going to have speakers with various types of computers that need to hook into your projection system. Not everybody has a standard 15-pin VGA output &#8212; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Visual_Interface">DVI</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mini_dvi">mini-DVI</a> connectors are also pretty common. Let them know what kind of connector your projector can hook up to, and make sure that they either have an appropriate adapter to bring with them, or that you have one, or that you can transfer their presentation someplace where you can access it. <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/">Slideshare</a> is a great resource to be familiar with. Encourage your speakers to upload and test their presentations with Slideshare, if feasible. Also make sure you have a couple of <acronym title="Universal Serial Bus"><span class="caps">USB</span></acronym> jumpdrives handy, for quick, last-minute file transfers.</li>\n<li><strong>Bigger Is Not Always Better</strong>: As I mentioned before, the logistics get more complicated as your group gets bigger. Big groups are great in some ways, but don&#8217;t feel obligated to accomodate a huge group if you aren&#8217;t sure you can arrange enough resources to handle them. Better to have a smaller, happy crowd, than a large angry mob (c.f., bandwidth, food). In particular, finding a low-cost location to host an event is going to be harder in proportion to the size of your group. But if you can definitely handle a big group, go for it!</li>\n<li><strong>Diversify Topics</strong>: At WordCamp Birmingham last year, we had a couple of speakers who didn&#8217;t really discuss WordPress at all. One of them spoke about freelance writing, and another spoke about how her doctor introduced her to &#8220;cancer blogging&#8221;. I found these talks to be just as engaging as anything else we heard. Also, for technical subjects, try to have topics that cover begining, intermediate, and advanced skill levels. In particular, one of the podcasts mentioned above complained about the lack of intermediate-level talks. Lastly, don&#8217;t allow too many &#8220;marketing&#8221; talks. Nobody wants to sit through what amounts to an hour-long infomercial.</li>\n<li><strong>Social Time</strong>: Make sure you allow some free time for people to socialize and network. Another complaint I heard was about an event where there was a video presentation <em>during</em> the luncheon. The attendees were frustrated that they felt obligated to listen to the presentation, when what they <em>wanted</em> to do was to talk amongst themselves. Also schedule short mid-morning and mid-afternoon breaks, if possible (don&#8217;t forget that everybody is drinking water, coffee, and soda).</li>\n<li><strong>Schwag</strong>: Even if everything else about your event is successful, people will probably think it was a little bit lame if you don&#8217;t have some sort of schwag (freebie items). For WordCamps, I believe that <a href="http://automattic.com/">Automattic</a> helps out with this a little. But don&#8217;t forget to hit up your sponsors, too. They should be happy to provide some logoed stickers, t-shirts, &#8220;stress balls&#8221;, pens, fridge magnets, or whatever. Also see if you can get a few &#8220;big ticket&#8221; items to raffle off at the end of your event. Books, software, hard drives, desk toys, and such make great raffle items. If one of your presenters has authored a book, hit them up for some autographed copies!</li>\n<li><strong>Thank Your Sponsors</strong>: Make a point to thank your sponsors before, during, and after your event. Point out to the attendees things like, &#8220;it&#8217;s time to enjoy a great catered buffet lunch from Joe&#8217;s Eatery, provided by our generous sponsor, FooCorp!&#8221; Or, &#8220;remember, our bandwidth is generously provided by Own-U-Net!&#8221; (keep in mind that all sponsors are generous).</li>\n<li><strong>Leverage Your Network</strong>: Personally, I would have no idea where to start with organizing an event. But I know people who do. I&#8217;d ask them for whatever help and advice I could get. And don&#8217;t be afraid to think outside the box. Tech companies aren&#8217;t the only ones interested in sponsorships. Try restaurants, bookstores, local business entrepreneurship groups, colleges, radio and television stations, ad agencies, etc. And don&#8217;t be afraid to think big: as I mentioned before, WordCamp Birmingham had <a href="http://microsoft.com/">Microsoft</a> as a sponsor (thanks for the BBQ, guys).</li>\n<li><strong>Plan Ahead</strong>: Don&#8217;t let your excitement over setting up an event trick you into committing to a date before you&#8217;re ready. I really don&#8217;t know a good guideline, but I would think that you probably need <em>at least</em> 3 months lead-time, and 4 would probably be better. I know I&#8217;ve seen a couple of events announced, then canceled, and I&#8217;m pretty sure that insufficient set-up time was part of the problem. Also, when you get close to nailing down the official date, you might want to see if there are other local or regional events that might conflict with your planned date.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There it is, my armchair-quarterback advice for organizing a conference. Take it with a big chunk of kosher salt, because I&#8217;ve never organized anything like this myself. But as a speaker and attendee, I&#8217;ve seen conferences that were well run, and some that were&#8230; not so well run. Obviously, you want to be in the former category. Out of all of this, <strong>you probably need to consider Bandwidth, Power, and Food to be your Holy Trinity</strong>. Handle those three things well, and everything else will go more smoothly.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve organized or attended a WordCamp or other technical conference, what other advice would <em>you</em> give?</p>";s:7:"pubdate";s:31:"Wed, 10 Jun 2009 15:30:41 +0000";s:2:"dc";a:1:{s:7:"creator";s:6:"Dougal";}s:7:"summary";s:10562:"<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-1150" title="WordPress Wednesday" src="http://dougal.gunters.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/wordpress-wednesday.png" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve <a href="http://dougal.gunters.org/blog/2009/06/01/whats-the-buzz">already posted about the WordPress 2.8 release</a>, and there will be plenty of other posts highlighting everybody&#8217;s favorite new features when it officially drops, so how about if I talk about something a little different? I&#8217;ve been listening to a couple of WordPress podcasts recently (<a href="http://www.wptavern.com/wordpress-weekly">WordPress Weekly</a> and <a href="http://wordcastpodcast.com/">WordCast</a>, in particular), and there had been a lot of buzz about some of the <a href="http://central.wordcamp.org/">WordCamp</a> gatherings taking place in various locations.</p>\n<p>In particular, there were a few complaints that were pointed out (and some kudos, as well), and it got me thinking about things that event organizers might want to plan ahead for when getting ready for future WordCamps. Having been a speaker at <a href="http://birmingham.wordcamp.org/">WordCamp Birmingham</a> last year (and planning to do it again this fall), I&#8217;m pleased to say that <a href="http://dresramblings.com/">Andre Natta</a> and his cohorts did an excellent job with that event. Some of that was probably made easier by the fact that it was a relatively small WordCamp (I think it was about 60 attendees). The bigger the group, the harder the logistics.</p>\n<p>In addtition to WordCamp, I&#8217;ve also attended a couple of other technical gatherings, like CodeCamp and SoCon, so some of  what I&#8217;ll speak to are from first-hand experience. That said, what are some of the areas that an organizer should give particular attention to? Here is my completely unsolicited, backseat-driver&#8217;s list of event organizer dos and don&#8217;ts:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>WiFi and Bandwidth</strong>: Poor internet connectivity is probably one of the most frequent complaints heard at just about any technical conference. Try to do whatever possible to ensure that you have enough bandwidth to handle your group size. If there are special setup/login instructions, make sure you provide that information to every attendee when they check in. It&#8217;s frustrating to spend the first couple of sessions trying to figure out how to get online.</li>\n<li><strong>Streaming</strong>: If you can, identify and designate just one or two people ahead of time to handle live video/audio streaming (and perhaps a backup person). Gently remind attendees that if several people are uplinking to <a href="http://www.ustream.tv/">ustream</a> simultaneously, it&#8217;s going to kill the network connection for everybody. Also, try to reserve good seats for those handling the videography.</li>\n<li><strong>A/C Power Outlets</strong>: Just about everybody there is going to have a laptop, and will need to charge their battery at some point. If it can be arranged, ensure that there are power outlets available. You might want to procure a bunch of extension cords and multi-outlet power strips. If outlets are in short supply, try to encourage people not to &#8220;camp&#8221; on them for the whole event, and to let others have access. Label your cords so that folks know that they belong to you, and are less likely to wander off with them.</li>\n<li><strong>Food</strong>: Be prepared to offer lunch, coffee, soft drinks, water, and maybe snacks. Try to find a sponsor for the event who can provide these things. At WordCamp Birmingham 2008, Microsoft sponsored lunch, arranging a catered buffet with salad, cole slaw, and BBQ sandwiches from a local restaurant. However, I&#8217;ll also suggest that you try to have an option suitable for vegetarians, too (something more substantial than an iceberg lettuce salad).</li>\n<li><strong>Hashtags</strong>: Decide ahead of time what the &#8220;official&#8221; hashtag for your event should be, make it known, and encourage attendees to use that. Keep it as short as possible while remaining unambiguous. I don&#8217;t know how many times I&#8217;ve seen somebody on <a href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter</a> saying &#8220;What&#8217;s the hashtag for the Dallas XYZ Conference? Is it #xyzconf, #xyz09, #xyzconf09, #dallasxyz, #xyzdfw09, or what?&#8221; Also, remind folks to use the hashtag when uploading photos to <a href="http://flickr.com/">Flickr</a>, and while you&#8217;re at it, go ahead and set up a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/">Flickr Group</a> for everyone to submit their photos to.</li>\n<li><strong>Adapters</strong>: You are going to have speakers with various types of computers that need to hook into your projection system. Not everybody has a standard 15-pin VGA output &#8212; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Visual_Interface">DVI</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mini_dvi">mini-DVI</a> connectors are also pretty common. Let them know what kind of connector your projector can hook up to, and make sure that they either have an appropriate adapter to bring with them, or that you have one, or that you can transfer their presentation someplace where you can access it. <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/">Slideshare</a> is a great resource to be familiar with. Encourage your speakers to upload and test their presentations with Slideshare, if feasible. Also make sure you have a couple of <acronym title="Universal Serial Bus"><span class="caps">USB</span></acronym> jumpdrives handy, for quick, last-minute file transfers.</li>\n<li><strong>Bigger Is Not Always Better</strong>: As I mentioned before, the logistics get more complicated as your group gets bigger. Big groups are great in some ways, but don&#8217;t feel obligated to accomodate a huge group if you aren&#8217;t sure you can arrange enough resources to handle them. Better to have a smaller, happy crowd, than a large angry mob (c.f., bandwidth, food). In particular, finding a low-cost location to host an event is going to be harder in proportion to the size of your group. But if you can definitely handle a big group, go for it!</li>\n<li><strong>Diversify Topics</strong>: At WordCamp Birmingham last year, we had a couple of speakers who didn&#8217;t really discuss WordPress at all. One of them spoke about freelance writing, and another spoke about how her doctor introduced her to &#8220;cancer blogging&#8221;. I found these talks to be just as engaging as anything else we heard. Also, for technical subjects, try to have topics that cover begining, intermediate, and advanced skill levels. In particular, one of the podcasts mentioned above complained about the lack of intermediate-level talks. Lastly, don&#8217;t allow too many &#8220;marketing&#8221; talks. Nobody wants to sit through what amounts to an hour-long infomercial.</li>\n<li><strong>Social Time</strong>: Make sure you allow some free time for people to socialize and network. Another complaint I heard was about an event where there was a video presentation <em>during</em> the luncheon. The attendees were frustrated that they felt obligated to listen to the presentation, when what they <em>wanted</em> to do was to talk amongst themselves. Also schedule short mid-morning and mid-afternoon breaks, if possible (don&#8217;t forget that everybody is drinking water, coffee, and soda).</li>\n<li><strong>Schwag</strong>: Even if everything else about your event is successful, people will probably think it was a little bit lame if you don&#8217;t have some sort of schwag (freebie items). For WordCamps, I believe that <a href="http://automattic.com/">Automattic</a> helps out with this a little. But don&#8217;t forget to hit up your sponsors, too. They should be happy to provide some logoed stickers, t-shirts, &#8220;stress balls&#8221;, pens, fridge magnets, or whatever. Also see if you can get a few &#8220;big ticket&#8221; items to raffle off at the end of your event. Books, software, hard drives, desk toys, and such make great raffle items. If one of your presenters has authored a book, hit them up for some autographed copies!</li>\n<li><strong>Thank Your Sponsors</strong>: Make a point to thank your sponsors before, during, and after your event.

Which brings me to the next task&#8230;</p>\n<h3>Blog about WordPress</h3>\n<p><strong>I&#8217;m doing this right now!</strong> Not only is it deliciously &#8220;meta,&#8221; it can raise your profile and help you connect with other WordPress developers and users. Write about a problem you solved, or a challenge you&#8217;d like to see addressed by WordPress core or a WordPress plugin. And don&#8217;t forget to blog about the plugins you write&#8230;</p>\n<h3>Write a bunch of useful plugins</h3>\n<p>This is probably the best thing you can do to get noticed by clients. Write a useful plugin and you&#8217;ll be getting business leads for years to come. You don&#8217;t have to write a really big, complicated plugin. Write something that will make using WordPress easier, more fun, more efficient, and people will remember you. It might be good to have one more ambitious plugin to serve as an example of your skills, but certainly don&#8217;t shy away from brevity. Some of the favorite things I&#8217;ve written are between 1 and 50 lines of code. Users don&#8217;t care about how big a plugin is. They just want it to serve a need. Go ahead and scratch their itch. Hint: monitor Google or Twitter for people saying &#8220;I want a WordPress plugin&#8230;&#8221; to get an idea of the sorts of needs that are currently unfulfilled.</p>\n<h3>Contribute to WordPress core</h3>\n<p>Contributing to the WordPress core software helps you in two ways. First, it provides continuing education. WordPress is constantly evolving, and you need to stay sharp! This is a great way to learn about (and influence) the direction of the WordPress codebase. Second, it raises your profile in the WordPress community (both the developer and user communities). Be sure to blog about your WordPress core contributions. <a href="http://core.trac.wordpress.org/">Trac</a> is a great place to start. Maintain a calm demeanor, and don&#8217;t get too big for your britches. Don&#8217;t be the person who comes in and embarrasses themselves by closing a ticket as &#8220;WONTFIX&#8221; that was opened by a seasoned developer! Watch how other tickets evolve and you&#8217;ll figure out how it works.</p>\n<h3>Stay in contact with more seasoned developers</h3>\n<p>A lot of us are busy, but we try to make time to mentor people. We&#8217;re all well-served by a vibrant development marketplace. Don&#8217;t be afraid to contact a more experienced developer for advice. The worst that will happen is that you&#8217;ll get ignored &#8212; apologies to anyone who is in my e-mail limbo&#8230; resend it if it&#8217;s been more than a few weeks!</p>\n<p>And as you get more experienced:</p>\n<h3>Speak at WordCamps and other events</h3>\n<p>Once you&#8217;ve gained enough kudos in the WP community, you&#8217;ll likely be asked to talk at a WordCamp event. And if you haven&#8217;t, and you think you could bring something special to the event, go ahead and ask if they need any more speakers! This will raise your profile further, introduce you to really cool people, and provide you with a bunch of business leads. BarCamps, social media gatherings, and other such events are also worth attending. The point isn&#8217;t to get up there and give a business pitch. In fact, your life might be in danger if you pull that stunt at a BarCamp. The point is to impart knowledge, connect with people, while letting your skills expose themselves naturally. And pitch away when you&#8217;re chatting up potential leads between sessions.</p>\n<h3>Charge according to your skill set and experience</h3>\n<p>Several years ago, I had the quasi-embarrassing surprise of being given a voluntary 75% per-hour raise by a client. I think they were afraid that my skills had outpaced my rate, and that I was going to get wooed away by a new client at a higher rate. Don&#8217;t make the mistake of charging too little. In fact, publish higher rates than you actually think you&#8217;re worth, and allow people to haggle you down (a little). And every time you get booked up and have to turn away business, raise your rate. If you&#8217;re in that much demand, you&#8217;re not charging enough.</p>\n<h3>Find a niche</h3>\n<p>But not WordPress security. That&#8217;s mine. <img src="http://s.wordpress.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>\n<p>A WordPress development niche is a niche within a niche. And that means you can charge more for your more specialized skills. Examples: migrating data to WordPress. Feed kung-fu. Re-implementing a design from another system. Custom write-panel plugins. Sidebar widgets.</p>\n  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/markjaquith.wordpress.com/310/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/markjaquith.wordpress.com/310/" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godelicious/markjaquith.wordpress.com/310/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/delicious/markjaquith.wordpress.com/310/" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gostumble/markjaquith.wordpress.com/310/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/stumble/markjaquith.wordpress.com/310/" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godigg/markjaquith.wordpress.com/310/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/digg/markjaquith.wordpress.com/310/" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/goreddit/markjaquith.wordpress.com/310/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/reddit/markjaquith.wordpress.com/310/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=markjaquith.wordpress.com&blog=316&post=310&subd=markjaquith&ref=&feed=1" /></div>";s:7:"pubdate";s:31:"Sun, 07 Jun 2009 03:57:01 +0000";s:2:"dc";a:1:{s:7:"creator";s:12:"Mark Jaquith";}s:7:"summary";s:6515:"<div class="snap_preview"><br /><p>I&#8217;ve had a bunch of people ask me how they could get started as a WordPress developer or consultant.

In fact, your life might be in danger if you pull that stunt at a BarCamp. The point is to impart knowledge, connect with people, while letting your skills expose themselves naturally. And pitch away when you&#8217;re chatting up potential leads between sessions.</p>\n<h3>Charge according to your skill set and experience</h3>\n<p>Several years ago, I had the quasi-embarrassing surprise of being given a voluntary 75% per-hour raise by a client. I think they were afraid that my skills had outpaced my rate, and that I was going to get wooed away by a new client at a higher rate. Don&#8217;t make the mistake of charging too little. In fact, publish higher rates than you actually think you&#8217;re worth, and allow people to haggle you down (a little). And every time you get booked up and have to turn away business, raise your rate. If you&#8217;re in that much demand, you&#8217;re not charging enough.</p>\n<h3>Find a niche</h3>\n<p>But not WordPress security. That&#8217;s mine. <img src="http://s.wordpress.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>\n<p>A WordPress development niche is a niche within a niche. And that means you can charge more for your more specialized skills. Examples: migrating data to WordPress. Feed kung-fu. Re-implementing a design from another system. Custom write-panel plugins. Sidebar widgets.</p>\n  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/markjaquith.wordpress.com/310/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/markjaquith.wordpress.com/310/" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godelicious/markjaquith.wordpress.com/310/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/delicious/markjaquith.wordpress.com/310/" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gostumble/markjaquith.wordpress.com/310/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/stumble/markjaquith.wordpress.com/310/" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/godigg/markjaquith.wordpress.com/310/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/digg/markjaquith.wordpress.com/310/" /></a> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/goreddit/markjaquith.wordpress.com/310/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/reddit/markjaquith.wordpress.com/310/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=markjaquith.wordpress.com&blog=316&post=310&subd=markjaquith&ref=&feed=1" /></div>";}i:29;a:7:{s:5:"title";s:41:"Alex King: WordPress Mobile Edition 3.0.5";s:4:"guid";s:64:"http://alexking.org/blog/2009/06/06/wordpress-mobile-edition-305";s:4:"link";s:64:"http://alexking.org/blog/2009/06/06/wordpress-mobile-edition-305";s:11:"description";s:1328:"<p>I&#8217;ve released a new version of my WordPress Mobile Edition plugin.

The same source also shares:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Specific blockages do appear to coincide with major events, like those in Tibet last year and the recent anniversary, but are also part of general and ever-changing blanket censorship.</p>\n<p>The Twitter blockage is really the only new story of the last week (apart from 5 second delay foreign television news blackouts) but the news media wanted to turn it into a larger story, including the Wordpress angle.</p>\n<p>Wordpress has been blocked for years now.  Youtube has been blocked for the last 3 months. Twitter went done last week.</p>\n<p>While the dates for the last two occurred at the same time as sensitive periods or events, I think both are more about controlling new forms of communication and networking than the particular events. Censorship in China is generally a one-way street with periods of activity ramping up around specific times. I think of it in the same way tax auditors get busy around tax season and government ministries around budget time. The difference being once a site is blocked by thePublic Security Bureau (PSB) here in China, it is very difficult to get it unblocked; given the public security connection in an already opaque closed-door administrative system. A good analogy is trying to get someone off a no-fly list in a bureaucratic security system that lacks transparency.</p>\n<p>Domestic blogging sites are heavily controlled and censored (though in an ad hoc way). Chinese video sharing sites are coming under increasing regulation and many believe it was only a matter of time before Twitter, as the newest uncontrolled networking site, was shut down.</p></blockquote>";s:7:"pubdate";s:31:"Sat, 06 Jun 2009 15:43:58 +0000";s:2:"dc";a:1:{s:7:"creator";s:5:"Lloyd";}s:7:"summary";s:5361:"<p>I&#8217;ve seen some reports lately that &#8220;WordPress is blocked in China&#8221;, including some <a href="http://mashable.com/2009/06/04/great-firewall-china/">Mashable</a> articles.

The same source also shares:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Specific blockages do appear to coincide with major events, like those in Tibet last year and the recent anniversary, but are also part of general and ever-changing blanket censorship.</p>\n<p>The Twitter blockage is really the only new story of the last week (apart from 5 second delay foreign television news blackouts) but the news media wanted to turn it into a larger story, including the Wordpress angle.</p>\n<p>Wordpress has been blocked for years now.  Youtube has been blocked for the last 3 months. Twitter went done last week.</p>\n<p>While the dates for the last two occurred at the same time as sensitive periods or events, I think both are more about controlling new forms of communication and networking than the particular events. Censorship in China is generally a one-way street with periods of activity ramping up around specific times. I think of it in the same way tax auditors get busy around tax season and government ministries around budget time. The difference being once a site is blocked by thePublic Security Bureau (PSB) here in China, it is very difficult to get it unblocked; given the public security connection in an already opaque closed-door administrative system. A good analogy is trying to get someone off a no-fly list in a bureaucratic security system that lacks transparency.</p>\n<p>Domestic blogging sites are heavily controlled and censored (though in an ad hoc way). Chinese video sharing sites are coming under increasing regulation and many believe it was only a matter of time before Twitter, as the newest uncontrolled networking site, was shut down.</p></blockquote>";}i:33;a:7:{s:5:"title";s:58:"Weblog Tools Collection: WordPress Theme Releases by 06/06";s:4:"guid";s:40:"http://weblogtoolscollection.com/?p=6019";s:4:"link";s:86:"http://weblogtoolscollection.com/archives/2009/06/06/wordpress-theme-releases-by-0606/";s:11:"description";s:2664:"<h4><a href="http://izandi.net/2009/05/blue-3-column-adsense-WordPress-themes/">Blue 3 Column Adsense</a></h4>\n<p><a href="http://izandi.net/Free_WordPress_Themes/Blue/"><img title="Blue" src="http://weblogtoolscollection.com/b2-img/2009/06/blue.jpg" alt="Blue" width="200" height="194" /></a></p>\n<p>Blue is 3 column adsense WordPress themes with blue color and fast loading.

I&#8217;m new here. I work for <a href="http://www.clearinteractive.com.au">Clear Interactive</a>. I live in Melbourne, Australia. I love great user experiences. I&#8217;m here to <a href="http://iphone.forums.wordpress.org/forum/requests-and-feedback">listen</a>. I&#8217;ve brought some friends with me as well.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve been talking with Automattic for some time now about the WordPress for iPhone application. About the project, the community and the passion behind it. We want the WordPress for iPhone application to be the best mobile blogging tool on the iPhone.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;d like to invite you into the thought process currently going on inside our collective heads.</p>\n<h2>Thinking Out Loud</h2>\n<p>First impressions count, it&#8217;s what I&#8217;d like to focus on right now. When you open WordPress for the first time you&#8217;re greeted with this screen:</p>\n<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-369" title="home screen" src="http://wpiphone.files.wordpress.com/2009/05/home-screen.png?w=320&#038;h=480" alt="home screen" width="320" height="480" /></p>\n<p>You have two options:</p>\n<ol>\n<li> &#8220;Set up your blog&#8221;</li>\n<li> &#8220;About WordPress for iPhone&#8221;</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The second option is interesting, but I&#8217;m not sure why it gets equal billing on the home screen when all anyone wants to do the first time they open the application is to set up their blog.</p>\n<p>The &#8220;Add Blog&#8221; screen should be shown by default if you haven&#8217;t already added one:</p>\n<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-368" title="add a blog" src="http://wpiphone.files.wordpress.com/2009/05/add-a-blog.png?w=320&#038;h=480" alt="add a blog" width="320" height="480" /></p>\n<p>Speaking of which, the cursor should already be placed in the &#8220;Blog URL&#8221; field and the keyboard should be displayed. There shouldn&#8217;t be an option to cancel as the application is unusable without at least one blog present.</p>\n<p>The &#8220;Save&#8221; button should be disabled until the &#8220;Blog URL&#8221;, &#8220;User Name&#8221; and &#8220;Password&#8221; fields have been filled in.

I&#8217;m new here. I work for <a href="http://www.clearinteractive.com.au">Clear Interactive</a>. I live in Melbourne, Australia. I love great user experiences. I&#8217;m here to <a href="http://iphone.forums.wordpress.org/forum/requests-and-feedback">listen</a>. I&#8217;ve brought some friends with me as well.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve been talking with Automattic for some time now about the WordPress for iPhone application. About the project, the community and the passion behind it. We want the WordPress for iPhone application to be the best mobile blogging tool on the iPhone.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;d like to invite you into the thought process currently going on inside our collective heads.</p>\n<h2>Thinking Out Loud</h2>\n<p>First impressions count, it&#8217;s what I&#8217;d like to focus on right now.

There shouldn&#8217;t be an option to cancel as the application is unusable without at least one blog present.</p>\n<p>The &#8220;Save&#8221; button should be disabled until the &#8220;Blog URL&#8221;, &#8220;User Name&#8221; and &#8220;Password&#8221; fields have been filled in.

How do you spend yours?</p>\n<p>So on to the “five”.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp125/">WP125</a> – This is a great plugin that can be used in two manners.&#160; One is for selling your own ad space for 125 x 125 graphic ads or you can use it as I do and link to affiliate sites you are a member of. I use it to link to my Amazon.com Associates account and my Xbox360 Game Exchange website (using 125 x 125 ads as well).&#160; The other slot tends to get used in ad exchanges with other sites. This comes with a Ads Widget that you can include in your sidebar or you can place code into your template tag wherever you want to place the ads. IT is highly configurable and can be set up in one or two column displays, show as many ads as you want, keep track of clicks and automatically removing the ad from circulation when its end date comes up. 25,468 downloads to date.</p>\n<p><a href="http://weblogtoolscollection.com/b2-img/2009/05/wp125settingspage.jpg"><img title="wp125settingspage" border="0" alt="wp125settingspage" src="http://weblogtoolscollection.com/b2-img/2009/05/wp125settingspage-thumb.jpg" width="244" height="166" /></a> </p>\n<p><a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/advertising-manager/">Advertising Manager</a> – This is the plugin previously known <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/adsense-manager/">Adsense Manager</a>.&#160; This one will manage and rotate ads from Google Adsense as well as Adbrite, Adify, AdGridWork, Adpinion, Chitika, Commission Junction, CrispAds, OpenX, ShoppingAds, Yahoo!PN and Widgetbucks.&#160; It will even accept the code for unsupported ad networks.&#160; Some of its key features is that it imports ad codes automatically, is compatible with widgets and sidebars, and it automatically limits the display of ads on a page to meet the ad networks rules (such as Google Adsense only allowing 3 ads per page). 24,476 downloads to date.</p>\n<p><a href="http://weblogtoolscollection.com/b2-img/2009/05/advertisingmanagermanageadpage.png"><img title="advertisingmanagermanageadpage" border="0" alt="advertisingmanagermanageadpage" src="http://weblogtoolscollection.com/b2-img/2009/05/advertisingmanagermanageadpage-thumb.png" width="154" height="244" /></a> </p>\n<p><a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/smart-ads/">Smart Ads</a> – This simple plugin inserts advertisements at the beginning and end of your blog entries based on how many words the post is, when it was written and its category.&#160; You can also insert your ads anywhere in a post or page by using the Smart Ads shortcode.&#160; This plugin even cleans itself out of your mySQL database if your using WordPress version 2.7 or higher. The development of this plugin is quite fresh - in fact it was just updated today and has been downloaded 8,652 times.</p>\n<p><a href="http://weblogtoolscollection.com/b2-img/2009/05/smartadssettingspage.jpg"><img title="smartadssettingspage" border="0" alt="smartadssettingspage" src="http://weblogtoolscollection.com/b2-img/2009/05/smartadssettingspage-thumb.jpg" width="244" height="168" /></a> </p>\n<p><a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-tag-ads/">WP Tag Ads</a> – This is a unique plugin that uses the tags on your blog entries to display eBay products based on those keywords on your post.&#160; Where Google Adsense scans your page and the words on it to get contextual ads this one just scans the tags.&#160; Ads are then displayed either within your page template or in a sidebar widget that comes with the plugin.&#160; You must have a Campain ID from eBay and they are free to get through the <a href="https://www.ebaypartnernetwork.com/">eBay Partner Network</a>.

How do you spend yours?</p>\n<p>So on to the “five”.</p>\n<blockquote><p><a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp125/">WP125</a> – This is a great plugin that can be used in two manners.&#160; One is for selling your own ad space for 125 x 125 graphic ads or you can use it as I do and link to affiliate sites you are a member of. I use it to link to my Amazon.com Associates account and my Xbox360 Game Exchange website (using 125 x 125 ads as well).&#160; The other slot tends to get used in ad exchanges with other sites. This comes with a Ads Widget that you can include in your sidebar or you can place code into your template tag wherever you want to place the ads. IT is highly configurable and can be set up in one or two column displays, show as many ads as you want, keep track of clicks and automatically removing the ad from circulation when its end date comes up. 25,468 downloads to date.</p>\n<p><a href="http://weblogtoolscollection.com/b2-img/2009/05/wp125settingspage.jpg"><img title="wp125settingspage" border="0" alt="wp125settingspage" src="http://weblogtoolscollection.com/b2-img/2009/05/wp125settingspage-thumb.jpg" width="244" height="166" /></a> </p>\n<p><a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/advertising-manager/">Advertising Manager</a> – This is the plugin previously known <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/adsense-manager/">Adsense Manager</a>.&#160; This one will manage and rotate ads from Google Adsense as well as Adbrite, Adify, AdGridWork, Adpinion, Chitika, Commission Junction, CrispAds, OpenX, ShoppingAds, Yahoo!PN and Widgetbucks.&#160; It will even accept the code for unsupported ad networks.&#160; Some of its key features is that it imports ad codes automatically, is compatible with widgets and sidebars, and it automatically limits the display of ads on a page to meet the ad networks rules (such as Google Adsense only allowing 3 ads per page). 24,476 downloads to date.</p>\n<p><a href="http://weblogtoolscollection.com/b2-img/2009/05/advertisingmanagermanageadpage.png"><img title="advertisingmanagermanageadpage" border="0" alt="advertisingmanagermanageadpage" src="http://weblogtoolscollection.com/b2-img/2009/05/advertisingmanagermanageadpage-thumb.png" width="154" height="244" /></a> </p>\n<p><a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/smart-ads/">Smart Ads</a> – This simple plugin inserts advertisements at the beginning and end of your blog entries based on how many words the post is, when it was written and its category.&#160; You can also insert your ads anywhere in a post or page by using the Smart Ads shortcode.&#160; This plugin even cleans itself out of your mySQL database if your using WordPress version 2.7 or higher. The development of this plugin is quite fresh - in fact it was just updated today and has been downloaded 8,652 times.</p>\n<p><a href="http://weblogtoolscollection.com/b2-img/2009/05/smartadssettingspage.jpg"><img title="smartadssettingspage" border="0" alt="smartadssettingspage" src="http://weblogtoolscollection.com/b2-img/2009/05/smartadssettingspage-thumb.jpg" width="244" height="168" /></a> </p>\n<p><a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-tag-ads/">WP Tag Ads</a> – This is a unique plugin that uses the tags on your blog entries to display eBay products based on those keywords on your post.&#160; Where Google Adsense scans your page and the words on it to get contextual ads this one just scans the tags.&#160; Ads are then displayed either within your page template or in a sidebar widget that comes with the plugin.&#160; You must have a Campain ID from eBay and they are free to get through the <a href="https://www.ebaypartnernetwork.com/">eBay Partner Network</a>.

(2, 1, '2009-06-03 09:56:45', '2009-06-03 09:56:45', 'Yogiraj Sri. Gagangiri Maharaj, who was revered and worshipped as Emperor Chalukya Pulakeshi, hails from Patankar family. His original personal name is Sripad and he belongs to village Manadure in Patan district of South Maharashtra. At the age of 7 he left his home and He went to Battees-Shirala. This place has a Math (ashram) of Nathsampradaya. This cult (sampradaya) has a wide following all over India and has about 1600 establishments.\r\n\r\nSri Gagangiri Maharaj as a youthful sanyasi, also moved about with Mahants (Senior Sages) right up to the Himalayas. During pilgrimages he learnt yoga and several occult and religious practices. He travelled far and wide to places such as Nepal, Bhutan, Manas Sarovar, Gaurishankar, (Gorak assembly), Gorakshdarbar, Gorakhpur, Pashupatinath and returned to Almora. Finally, he travelled through the valley of Ganga, Himachal Pradesh and reached.\r\n\r\nNear Badrika Ashram there ice-clad mountains, where Gagangiri Maharaj was extremely tired as a result of his peregrinations and he decided to settle in a cave. When he was relaxing, a sage wearing saffron robes came there from the mountains. He sprinkled water from his Kamandalu, on the face of Gagangiri Maharaj. He also gave him some kind of green grass to eat which resembled coriander leaves. For his penance, he had prepared mattresses of grass. He found his mattresses growing like living vegetation. This was considered as an experience, where Tantrik technique is perfected. He did a number of Kaya Kalpas (Rejuvenation). In this process he invented several new concepts in Tantrik techniques and proved them true.\r\n\r\nHe said "You will now attain the state of salvation, and you shall be responsible for the welfare of humanity and you shall go to the South". Accordingly, Maharaj moved from the valley. He experienced a lot of difficulties and arrived at Rhishikesh. Swamiji then decided to move all over India alone on foot and accordingly his journey started.\r\n\r\nHe did penance at a number of places like Mauli Kund, Mauli Kada, Zanzu water, Mausame Kada, Kasarbari, Ginger water, Sat-barkund, Holi Kada, Margaj water, Jungledeo patti, Shirale etc. During monsoon, he stayed in the cave at Garbhagiri, Gagangiri. He did penance in a pond near the river at Sangashi, Vazar, Vesraf, Palsambe, Ramling etc. Later he went to Vijaydurg, in the Konkan area from where he reached Bombay by steamer. During 1945 to 1948, he did Kayakalpa at Angale, near Rajapur in Konkan.\r\n\r\nAt Bhopal while he was taking rest after bath near a tank, the princely ruler of Kolhapur and his retinue happened to be nearby while on a brief visit. Swamiji''s mother tongue being Marathi, a conversation between him and Kolhapur ruler''s retinue ensued resulting in the Ruler requesting Swamiji to accompany him to Kolhapur. In 1932 the Raja of Kolhapur had been to Dajipur jungle for hunting. Swamiji who had accompanied him stayed back in the jungle, where he lived from 1932 to 1940. He spent these years in meditation and deep reflection.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning Sri Maharaj built a hut on the outskirts of the shepherd colony, in the dense forest, thick with trees and plants of infinite varieties, he revelled with satisfaction as he had found an ideal site for penance and meditation. He was also interested in acquiring Tantrik knowledgle and was able to gain a lot of information about the spirit world (ghosts), secrets of birth and death, during the period of penance.\r\n\r\nIn Bombay between 1948 to 1950, he stayed in Dadi Hirji Parsi graveyards, near the temple of Maruti, at shidi near Walkeshwar.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, he did penance in the barren, rocky beach at Breach Candy, Mahalaxmi, BanGanga etc. He also did penance in the Papeti bunglow of Dadi Hirji, as well as near the well in the graveyard. During this period several rulers and princes such as Sayajirao Gaikwad, Madhavrao Shinde, Chhatrapati Shahu Maharaj, Rajaram Maharaj (Kolhapur), Bavdekar Sarkar and Bhausaheb Pant Amatya, Maharani Tarabai (Sayajirao, Gaikwad''s daughter) and a number of ruling families of Kolhapur came for his blessings. He had occasion to visit and stay at several places. These ruling families used to visit jungles for hunting during summer and leave the jungles when the rainy season set in.\r\n\r\nSri Maharaj built small shelters for himself in the caves of trees as his dwelling place. Usually, he would select a tree with abundant supply of fruit and vegetables. In order to protect himself from rains, he would devise some kind of clothes made from the bark of trees, such as Kumbha, Apta and Palas. Usually leaves and the threads would be used to prepare a cloth called as Irla. This he would put on his head to protect himself from the rains. He used to call it as his mobile home. He would use threads and ropes from tree trunks, for loin - cloth towels, shawls, bed covers for himself. This rough attire known as Walkal would be sufficient for him as protection in rainy days, for continuing his penance.\r\n\r\nThis continuous penance and struggle helped him to achieve considerable amount of self-realization, which was of immense benefit for him. This resulted in a great Punya or spiritual merit. As people benefited from his meditation, they started worshipping and respecting him.\r\n\r\nHis life style can be described in words "Such a Yogi Living alone by himself understand and accomplishes the Art of Life." Living alone sleeping on the banks of rivers, listening to the flowing of the river water, drying the entire body by solar radiation, sleeping on rock, meditating continuously, staying absolutely still under water, keeping mind completely at rest, keeping all the physical desires under control and having only clean, hygienic, pious, wholesome pure and acceptable food. All this is the life of the perfect yogi.\r\n\r\nTherefore, one should always crave for the company of a Sadhu, serve him as much as possible and respect him. We should always think reverently of a Sadhu because a saintly person bestows peace of mind on us.', 'ABOUT', 0, '', 'publish', 'closed', 'closed', '', 'about', '', '', '2009-06-04 09:15:17', '2009-06-04 09:15:17', '', 0, 'http://www.gagangiriv1.com/?page_id=2', 1, 'page', '', 0),

(46, 1, '2009-06-03 10:59:48', '2009-06-03 10:59:48', 'Yogiraj Sri. Gagangiri Maharaj, who was revered and worshipped as Emperor Chalukya Pulakeshi, hails from Patankar family. His original personal name is Sripad and he belongs to village Manadure in Patan district of South Maharashtra. At the age of 7 he left his home and He went to Battees-Shirala. This place has a Math (ashram) of Nathsampradaya. This cult (sampradaya) has a wide following all over India and has about 1600 establishments.\r\n\r\nSri Gagangiri Maharaj as a youthful sanyasi, also moved about with Mahants (Senior Sages) right up to the Himalayas. During pilgrimages he learnt yoga and several occult and religious practices. He travelled far and wide to places such as Nepal, Bhutan, Manas Sarovar, Gaurishankar, (Gorak assembly), Gorakshdarbar, Gorakhpur, Pashupatinath and returned to Almora. Finally, he travelled through the valley of Ganga, Himachal Pradesh and reached.\r\n\r\nNear Badrika Ashram there ice-clad mountains, where Gagangiri Maharaj was extremely tired as a result of his peregrinations and he decided to settle in a cave. When he was relaxing, a sage wearing saffron robes came there from the mountains. He sprinkled water from his Kamandalu, on the face of Gagangiri Maharaj. He also gave him some kind of green grass to eat which resembled coriander leaves. For his penance, he had prepared mattresses of grass. He found his mattresses growing like living vegetation. This was considered as an experience, where Tantrik technique is perfected. He did a number of Kaya Kalpas (Rejuvenation). In this process he invented several new concepts in Tantrik techniques and proved them true.\r\n\r\nHe said "You will now attain the state of salvation, and you shall be responsible for the welfare of humanity and you shall go to the South". Accordingly, Maharaj moved from the valley. He experienced a lot of difficulties and arrived at Rhishikesh. Swamiji then decided to move all over India alone on foot and accordingly his journey started.\r\n\r\nHe did penance at a number of places like Mauli Kund, Mauli Kada, Zanzu water, Mausame Kada, Kasarbari, Ginger water, Sat-barkund, Holi Kada, Margaj water, Jungledeo patti, Shirale etc. During monsoon, he stayed in the cave at Garbhagiri, Gagangiri. He did penance in a pond near the river at Sangashi, Vazar, Vesraf, Palsambe, Ramling etc. Later he went to Vijaydurg, in the Konkan area from where he reached Bombay by steamer. During 1945 to 1948, he did Kayakalpa at Angale, near Rajapur in Konkan.\r\n\r\nAt Bhopal while he was taking rest after bath near a tank, the princely ruler of Kolhapur and his retinue happened to be nearby while on a brief visit. Swamiji''s mother tongue being Marathi, a conversation between him and Kolhapur ruler''s retinue ensued resulting in the Ruler requesting Swamiji to accompany him to Kolhapur. In 1932 the Raja of Kolhapur had been to Dajipur jungle for hunting. Swamiji who had accompanied him stayed back in the jungle, where he lived from 1932 to 1940. He spent these years in meditation and deep reflection.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning Sri Maharaj built a hut on the outskirts of the shepherd colony, in the dense forest, thick with trees and plants of infinite varieties, he revelled with satisfaction as he had found an ideal site for penance and meditation. He was also interested in acquiring Tantrik knowledgle and was able to gain a lot of information about the spirit world (ghosts), secrets of birth and death, during the period of penance.\r\n\r\nIn Bombay between 1948 to 1950, he stayed in Dadi Hirji Parsi graveyards, near the temple of Maruti, at shidi near Walkeshwar.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, he did penance in the barren, rocky beach at Breach Candy, Mahalaxmi, BanGanga etc. He also did penance in the Papeti bunglow of Dadi Hirji, as well as near the well in the graveyard. During this period several rulers and princes such as Sayajirao Gaikwad, Madhavrao Shinde, Chhatrapati Shahu Maharaj, Rajaram Maharaj (Kolhapur), Bavdekar Sarkar and Bhausaheb Pant Amatya, Maharani Tarabai (Sayajirao, Gaikwad''s daughter) and a number of ruling families of Kolhapur came for his blessings. He had occasion to visit and stay at several places. These ruling families used to visit jungles for hunting during summer and leave the jungles when the rainy season set in.\r\n\r\nSri Maharaj built small shelters for himself in the caves of trees as his dwelling place. Usually, he would select a tree with abundant supply of fruit and vegetables. In order to protect himself from rains, he would devise some kind of clothes made from the bark of trees, such as Kumbha, Apta and Palas. Usually leaves and the threads would be used to prepare a cloth called as Irla. This he would put on his head to protect himself from the rains. He used to call it as his mobile home. He would use threads and ropes from tree trunks, for loin - cloth towels, shawls, bed covers for himself. This rough attire known as Walkal would be sufficient for him as protection in rainy days, for continuing his penance.\r\n\r\nThis continuous penance and struggle helped him to achieve considerable amount of self-realization, which was of immense benefit for him. This resulted in a great Punya or spiritual merit. As people benefited from his meditation, they started worshipping and respecting him.\r\n\r\nHis life style can be described in words "Such a Yogi Living alone by himself understand and accomplishes the Art of Life." Living alone sleeping on the banks of rivers, listening to the flowing of the river water, drying the entire body by solar radiation, sleeping on rock, meditating continuously, staying absolutely still under water, keeping mind completely at rest, keeping all the physical desires under control and having only clean, hygienic, pious, wholesome pure and acceptable food. All this is the life of the perfect yogi.\r\n\r\nTherefore, one should always crave for the company of a Sadhu, serve him as much as possible and respect him. We should always think reverently of a Sadhu because a saintly person bestows peace of mind on us.', 'ABOUT', 0, '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '2-revision-8', '', '', '2009-06-03 10:59:48', '2009-06-03 10:59:48', '', 2, 'http://www.gagangiriv1.com/2-revision-8/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

(60, 1, '2009-06-04 03:55:40', '2009-06-04 03:55:40', 'Yogiraj Sri. Gagangiri Maharaj, who was revered and worshipped as Emperor Chalukya Pulakeshi, hails from Patankar family. His original personal name is Sripad and he belongs to village Manadure in Patan district of South Maharashtra. At the age of 7 he left his home and He went to Battees-Shirala. This place has a Math (ashram) of Nathsampradaya. This cult (sampradaya) has a wide following all over India and has about 1600 establishments.\r\n\r\nSri Gagangiri Maharaj as a youthful sanyasi, also moved about with Mahants (Senior Sages) right up to the Himalayas. During pilgrimages he learnt yoga and several occult and religious practices. He travelled far and wide to places such as Nepal, Bhutan, Manas Sarovar, Gaurishankar, (Gorak assembly), Gorakshdarbar, Gorakhpur, Pashupatinath and returned to Almora. Finally, he travelled through the valley of Ganga, Himachal Pradesh and reached.\r\n\r\nNear Badrika Ashram there ice-clad mountains, where Gagangiri Maharaj was extremely tired as a result of his peregrinations and he decided to settle in a cave. When he was relaxing, a sage wearing saffron robes came there from the mountains. He sprinkled water from his Kamandalu, on the face of Gagangiri Maharaj. He also gave him some kind of green grass to eat which resembled coriander leaves. For his penance, he had prepared mattresses of grass. He found his mattresses growing like living vegetation. This was considered as an experience, where Tantrik technique is perfected. He did a number of Kaya Kalpas (Rejuvenation). In this process he invented several new concepts in Tantrik techniques and proved them true.\r\n\r\nHe said "You will now attain the state of salvation, and you shall be responsible for the welfare of humanity and you shall go to the South". Accordingly, Maharaj moved from the valley. He experienced a lot of difficulties and arrived at Rhishikesh. Swamiji then decided to move all over India alone on foot and accordingly his journey started.\r\n\r\nHe did penance at a number of places like Mauli Kund, Mauli Kada, Zanzu water, Mausame Kada, Kasarbari, Ginger water, Sat-barkund, Holi Kada, Margaj water, Jungledeo patti, Shirale etc. During monsoon, he stayed in the cave at Garbhagiri, Gagangiri. He did penance in a pond near the river at Sangashi, Vazar, Vesraf, Palsambe, Ramling etc. Later he went to Vijaydurg, in the Konkan area from where he reached Bombay by steamer. During 1945 to 1948, he did Kayakalpa at Angale, near Rajapur in Konkan.\r\n\r\nAt Bhopal while he was taking rest after bath near a tank, the princely ruler of Kolhapur and his retinue happened to be nearby while on a brief visit. Swamiji''s mother tongue being Marathi, a conversation between him and Kolhapur ruler''s retinue ensued resulting in the Ruler requesting Swamiji to accompany him to Kolhapur. In 1932 the Raja of Kolhapur had been to Dajipur jungle for hunting. Swamiji who had accompanied him stayed back in the jungle, where he lived from 1932 to 1940. He spent these years in meditation and deep reflection.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning Sri Maharaj built a hut on the outskirts of the shepherd colony, in the dense forest, thick with trees and plants of infinite varieties, he revelled with satisfaction as he had found an ideal site for penance and meditation. He was also interested in acquiring Tantrik knowledgle and was able to gain a lot of information about the spirit world (ghosts), secrets of birth and death, during the period of penance.\r\n\r\nIn Bombay between 1948 to 1950, he stayed in Dadi Hirji Parsi graveyards, near the temple of Maruti, at shidi near Walkeshwar.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, he did penance in the barren, rocky beach at Breach Candy, Mahalaxmi, BanGanga etc. He also did penance in the Papeti bunglow of Dadi Hirji, as well as near the well in the graveyard. During this period several rulers and princes such as Sayajirao Gaikwad, Madhavrao Shinde, Chhatrapati Shahu Maharaj, Rajaram Maharaj (Kolhapur), Bavdekar Sarkar and Bhausaheb Pant Amatya, Maharani Tarabai (Sayajirao, Gaikwad''s daughter) and a number of ruling families of Kolhapur came for his blessings. He had occasion to visit and stay at several places. These ruling families used to visit jungles for hunting during summer and leave the jungles when the rainy season set in.\r\n\r\nSri Maharaj built small shelters for himself in the caves of trees as his dwelling place. Usually, he would select a tree with abundant supply of fruit and vegetables. In order to protect himself from rains, he would devise some kind of clothes made from the bark of trees, such as Kumbha, Apta and Palas. Usually leaves and the threads would be used to prepare a cloth called as Irla. This he would put on his head to protect himself from the rains. He used to call it as his mobile home. He would use threads and ropes from tree trunks, for loin - cloth towels, shawls, bed covers for himself. This rough attire known as Walkal would be sufficient for him as protection in rainy days, for continuing his penance.\r\n\r\nThis continuous penance and struggle helped him to achieve considerable amount of self-realization, which was of immense benefit for him. This resulted in a great Punya or spiritual merit. As people benefited from his meditation, they started worshipping and respecting him.\r\n\r\nHis life style can be described in words "Such a Yogi Living alone by himself understand and accomplishes the Art of Life." Living alone sleeping on the banks of rivers, listening to the flowing of the river water, drying the entire body by solar radiation, sleeping on rock, meditating continuously, staying absolutely still under water, keeping mind completely at rest, keeping all the physical desires under control and having only clean, hygienic, pious, wholesome pure and acceptable food. All this is the life of the perfect yogi.\r\n\r\nTherefore, one should always crave for the company of a Sadhu, serve him as much as possible and respect him. We should always think reverently of a Sadhu because a saintly person bestows peace of mind on us.', 'ABOUT', 0, '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '2-revision-9', '', '', '2009-06-04 03:55:40', '2009-06-04 03:55:40', '', 2, 'http://www.gagangiriv1.com/2-revision-9/', 0, 'revision', '', 0);

(75, 1, '2009-06-04 04:22:38', '2009-06-04 04:22:38', 'Yogiraj Sri. Gagangiri Maharaj, who was revered and worshipped as Emperor Chalukya Pulakeshi, hails from Patankar family. His original personal name is Sripad and he belongs to village Manadure in Patan district of South Maharashtra. At the age of 7 he left his home and He went to Battees-Shirala. This place has a Math (ashram) of Nathsampradaya. This cult (sampradaya) has a wide following all over India and has about 1600 establishments.\r\n\r\nSri Gagangiri Maharaj as a youthful sanyasi, also moved about with Mahants (Senior Sages) right up to the Himalayas. During pilgrimages he learnt yoga and several occult and religious practices. He travelled far and wide to places such as Nepal, Bhutan, Manas Sarovar, Gaurishankar, (Gorak assembly), Gorakshdarbar, Gorakhpur, Pashupatinath and returned to Almora. Finally, he travelled through the valley of Ganga, Himachal Pradesh and reached.\r\n\r\nNear Badrika Ashram there ice-clad mountains, where Gagangiri Maharaj was extremely tired as a result of his peregrinations and he decided to settle in a cave. When he was relaxing, a sage wearing saffron robes came there from the mountains. He sprinkled water from his Kamandalu, on the face of Gagangiri Maharaj. He also gave him some kind of green grass to eat which resembled coriander leaves. For his penance, he had prepared mattresses of grass. He found his mattresses growing like living vegetation. This was considered as an experience, where Tantrik technique is perfected. He did a number of Kaya Kalpas (Rejuvenation). In this process he invented several new concepts in Tantrik techniques and proved them true.\r\n\r\nHe said "You will now attain the state of salvation, and you shall be responsible for the welfare of humanity and you shall go to the South". Accordingly, Maharaj moved from the valley. He experienced a lot of difficulties and arrived at Rhishikesh. Swamiji then decided to move all over India alone on foot and accordingly his journey started.\r\n\r\nHe did penance at a number of places like Mauli Kund, Mauli Kada, Zanzu water, Mausame Kada, Kasarbari, Ginger water, Sat-barkund, Holi Kada, Margaj water, Jungledeo patti, Shirale etc. During monsoon, he stayed in the cave at Garbhagiri, Gagangiri. He did penance in a pond near the river at Sangashi, Vazar, Vesraf, Palsambe, Ramling etc. Later he went to Vijaydurg, in the Konkan area from where he reached Bombay by steamer. During 1945 to 1948, he did Kayakalpa at Angale, near Rajapur in Konkan.\r\n\r\nAt Bhopal while he was taking rest after bath near a tank, the princely ruler of Kolhapur and his retinue happened to be nearby while on a brief visit. Swamiji''s mother tongue being Marathi, a conversation between him and Kolhapur ruler''s retinue ensued resulting in the Ruler requesting Swamiji to accompany him to Kolhapur. In 1932 the Raja of Kolhapur had been to Dajipur jungle for hunting. Swamiji who had accompanied him stayed back in the jungle, where he lived from 1932 to 1940. He spent these years in meditation and deep reflection.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning Sri Maharaj built a hut on the outskirts of the shepherd colony, in the dense forest, thick with trees and plants of infinite varieties, he revelled with satisfaction as he had found an ideal site for penance and meditation. He was also interested in acquiring Tantrik knowledgle and was able to gain a lot of information about the spirit world (ghosts), secrets of birth and death, during the period of penance.\r\n\r\nIn Bombay between 1948 to 1950, he stayed in Dadi Hirji Parsi graveyards, near the temple of Maruti, at shidi near Walkeshwar.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, he did penance in the barren, rocky beach at Breach Candy, Mahalaxmi, BanGanga etc. He also did penance in the Papeti bunglow of Dadi Hirji, as well as near the well in the graveyard. During this period several rulers and princes such as Sayajirao Gaikwad, Madhavrao Shinde, Chhatrapati Shahu Maharaj, Rajaram Maharaj (Kolhapur), Bavdekar Sarkar and Bhausaheb Pant Amatya, Maharani Tarabai (Sayajirao, Gaikwad''s daughter) and a number of ruling families of Kolhapur came for his blessings. He had occasion to visit and stay at several places. These ruling families used to visit jungles for hunting during summer and leave the jungles when the rainy season set in.\r\n\r\nSri Maharaj built small shelters for himself in the caves of trees as his dwelling place.

The first day of the NEW YEAR. Financial year is over, balance sheets are completed at various places by reviewing and comparing income and expenditure of previous year to that of present year and budget is planned for the next year. This is regarding finance.\r\n\r\nNow we will analyse our own nature. What good habits/ qualities we have adopted this year and what bad habits/qualities we have given up has to be reviewed. Whether our personality is developed or there is no change or whether it has gone bad that we will study now.\r\n\r\nThe qualities which will make our life perfect and fully developed are confidence, determination, self-control, fearlessness, happiness and thoughtfulness. Now we will see which of these qualities are already possessed by us and which qualities we have acquired now. We become happy when we see the balance left with us at the end of the year. The same degree of happiness overcomes us when we find that we have conquered over bad qualities by developing new habits and qualities among ourselves.\r\n\r\nWe know what is good and also know what is bad. By experience we learn that if we intend to do something we can do it. And therefore we must always determine to do good only.\r\n\r\nAs the age, power and status of the man rise his behaviour is expected to be more polished and well-mannered. We must understand that if we are four steps ahead this year, of last year then it is binding upon us to go further four steps ahead next year. Andif we have lagged (fallen) behind by four steps last year then we should be prepared to move eight steps ahead by finding out the reasons of lagging behind. When we become critic, then only we can evaluate ourselves and notice our faults which can be rectified by us in future. To conclude, when we are alone to ourselves, we should go through the diary of balance of income and expenditure of day today life."', 'BALANCE SHEET OF HUMAN NATURE', 0, '', 'publish', 'closed', 'closed', '', 'balance-sheet-of-human-nature', '', '', '2009-06-05 04:31:52', '2009-06-05 04:31:52', '', 24, 'http://www.gagangiriv1.com/?page_id=105', 1, 'page', '', 0),

The growing crisis entraps the life of the common man, whose needs continue to increase, making the problem more and more acute. Roughing it up against all these odds with courage and a firm stand will resolve some challenges. But basically an attitude of self-reliance and cooperation is needed to counter this negative environment. Acceptance of the commitments and challenges in one''s life with poise and an open attitude is the first threshold of spiritual life."\r\n\r\nWhen you come to this mountain, I appeal to you to shift your attitude. A shift from the pursuit of need fulfillment and personal problems towards the quest for knowledge and wisdom. There is the fundamental difference in the life of a Yogi and other human beings. The common man is perpetually dependent. He is ignorant and unsure of his capabilities. He has not developed the ability to use his creative intelligence. He lives on borrowed knowledge. How long can you pull-on with a borrowed existence ? On the other hand, a Yogi is autonomous. He is self contained and complete."\r\n\r\n"In all these years of your pilgrimage to Gagangad, the Immense Power within these hills has barely touched anyone - Living on this mountain demands a rare courage. Initially the environment here appears lonely, desolate and scary ! But as one fathoms this Void, one can hear a call from the unknown. It will be the beginning of a dialogue. This mountain breathes ! It radiates tremendous energy. This Power can absorb and engulf any human suffering or sorrow. My life has been ever renewed by it, making me respond moment to moment.\r\n\r\nHuman senses and intellect undergo a mutation through an association with this Immensity. Now my body does not have an existence by itself. It has developed a strong permanent bond with this Power. The Power has taught me devotion. It has taught me to assume responsibility and action for the world."\r\n\r\n"With Divine grace, we have embarked upon an odyssey. We must act, with commitment, faith and devotion. Success should not blind us nor failures confuse us. We are ever guided by the Void. The world evolves from it. Our creative intelligence, guided by the energy from the Void, can help us in meeting today''s challenges."', 'CALL OF OTHER WORLD', 0, '', 'publish', 'closed', 'closed', '', 'call-of-other-world', '', '', '2009-06-05 04:32:25', '2009-06-05 04:32:25', '', 24, 'http://www.gagangiriv1.com/?page_id=115', 5, 'page', '', 0),

(117, 1, '2009-06-04 10:02:04', '2009-06-04 10:02:04', 'In the early hours of the morning, it was very quiet and peaceful in the Khopoli Ashram. Gagangiri Maharaj was sitting in the meditative posture in his cottage. After my initial talk with him, Maharaj expressed that he would now prefer to sit in the stream. We moved out and entered the flowing water. He pointed out a place for me to sit near him, and for a few minutes he took a dip in the water.\r\n\r\nAfter some time, Ashish came with tea. He is a young graduate who is spending the last five or six months in the company of Maharaj, serving him. Maharaj looked at him and said, "Because of such a close contact with me, Ashish has now observed, many things about me. He would tell you about my body purification processes and the art of absorbing energy from nature. This process transforms one''s body. Ashish has personally seen how the transformation of energy brings luster and when I am surrounded by people and crowds, energy gets lost".\r\n\r\nI felt very happy because Maharaj had opened a topic about which I wanted to know more from him. He too was very enthusiastic, giving details about the art of absorbing energy, Maharaj was referring to the fifth stage of Patanjali Yoga. There are eight aspects of Yoga according to Patanjali. The first four steps ''Yam'', ''Niyam'',''Asan'',''Pranayam'' are like laying down the foundation, but the next four steps are advanced stages for doing meditation.\r\n\r\n''Pratyahar'' is the art of withdrawal of the senses. The fifth stage is only possible when you have the right attitude and have purified your mind and body. The later stages of meditation are ''Dharana'', ''Dhyana'', and ''Samadhi''. Maharaj stood up and said that his body is like a shield protecting him from any human pollution and temptations. He continued the subject.\r\n\r\n"We have to master skillfully, the technique of withdrawal of the senses from the sense objects. The external world is always pressurizing us with stimuli but as conscious humans we have to develop our choice of alternatives and willpower. We should act and not react to these external challenges. Many people, I see, have not mastered the art of ''Pratyahar, and they react and get caught in the net of their negative feelings. ''Pratyahar'' is the real beginning of Yoga and the one who has learnt ''I this art is the master and not a victim in any situation or environment. Such withdrawal of senses, stops the wastage of energy. Energy is preserved now for developing one pointed concentration. ''Dharana'' and ''Dhyana'' are the stages of such meditative awareness and mindfulness. Later it takes us to the height of ''Samadhi''. So ''Pratyahar'' is a significant step, the turning point, in one''s development. Look at my body ! It is hard like metal and it is also delicate like a flower in facing the external challenges and situations. But I am always able to master a situation and ''Pratyahar'' is my secret".\r\n\r\nMaharaj was very communicative and eager to convey some of his esoteric insights. He continued,\r\n"I would like to tell you more about the ''Navanaths'', And other great yogis who stay in the mountains. They live on pure air and do not require any solid food. They are alone. They do not depend on human beings or on any external things and are self-reliant and autonomous to the highest degree. Such rare groups of Yogis have preserved our spiritual culture. Even today, our esoteric tradition is kept alive because of them. Their presence radiates the eternal Vedantic truths. It is not book knowledge or somebody''s report or a mere belief or an inference. I see their very presence catalyzing the growth of other evolving souls ''The second level of work is the purification of the body and cleansing of impure, solidified sensations. The heaviness and inertia of the body is reduced and it becomes very light like a feather. A purified body is like a fine instrument for knowing oneself, for knowing the world, and contacting the Divine. Such triple consciousness can lead us to another level of reality".\r\n\r\n"in the triple mode of consciousness, the Yogi is first aware of his own body-mind system and observes from moment to moment the complex inward processes which are happening inside him. Secondly as he is not a closed being, he is also listening attentively to the world and to the people. He is aware of their individual and collective problems. With a sense of objectivity and detachment coupled with involvement and participation, he can find out relevant solutions to their problems.\r\n\r\nThirdly his uniqueness lies in being aware of the dynamic potentiality of the Other World : the Divine World of Peace, Compassion and Beauty. Through his meditative awareness, he is praying on behalf of the many for bringing Grace and Happiness to all. The normal human world is a world full of problems and sufferings. The many artificial boundaries we draw for our safety, enclose us and we are stuck and doomed forever unless the Other World intervenes for our redemption. The Other World is the Unknown and Mystery. It is the inexhaustible. power ruling the universe". "The great task of the Yogi is not only the act of balance, but practicing the art of synthesis of the three modes of consciousness. The state of Triple Consciousness empowers him to play the roles of a friend, a healer, a teacher and the facilitator for a global transformation. For him the terms like life / death have lost their outer meanings. Life and death are not opposing categories but complementaries for any growth. So, what is generally called as life by others is a state of dying to him and what is commonly understood as death by many is an opportunity for the renewal of real life to him. Death is the Greatest Guru of all, teaching the lessons of negation and compassionate affirmation. The Yogi is a traveler between the worlds to life and death and frequently and leisurely camping and scouting in the intermediate, twilight zone of consciousness for nourishment and creativity. The canvas of his life now covers the Whole Time - the past, the present and the future. There is no tomorrow, but only Now".\r\n\r\n"Because of old religious prejudices, for centuries we have looked down and condemned the physical body as an enemy, and as a heavy liability. We have neglected the growth of the potential which is in us. The body as it is now is pampered and misused. True, the body with it''s unruly desires and passions has posed problems. But the same body if taken into confidence and spoken to, could be developed as a sensitive instrument for the holistic growth. In fact the ''Hatha'' and ''Tantra'' Yogas know and utilise the body with it''s passions as an asset and sublimate these energies for spiritual powers and siddhis. A purified body is a new vehicle for unknown energy paths".\r\n\r\n"The work is not merely purifying the body but becoming a refined instrument to receive energy from everything.\r\n\r\nNow the third level is to enter the energy field. Every object radiates some energy. Group of objects create fields of energies. Objects are radiating positive and negative energies. The purified mind is capable of receiving energies through new sensations. A great Yogi ''eats'' and ''devours'' such energy and that is why I said earlier that he doesn''t require solid food. I can point out a few examples. See that blooming yellow flower; it is giving me energy. Observe that light on the greenish water; it is sparkling with energy. See that bird on the wing; it conveys another subtle energy. The whole green foliage around the Ashram is giving me abundant energy. Look at those red bricks, I feel their baked hot energy.\r\n\r\nSince I am able to absorb such energies, subtle bodily and physiolgical changes are taking place in me. Ashish has noticed how the colour of my hair changes from black to gray and some times it turns into gold". While listening to him today, I felt a clarity about a new mode of perception which we could experiment and try. Why not ? But I was questioning how this could be possible not only with Maharaj, but also with a seeking few.\r\n\r\n"What I say is also the experience of great Rishis. Even the Buddhist Monks and the Jain Sadhus speak about the same level of reality. Sensitive souls get nourished by such energy processes and their brains do not operate on mere ideas and inference. Food is a very small item in terms of energy to them. For a normal person, when he takes food, it require six to eight hours for its conversion into blood and the rest is thrown out as waste. But the great Yogis do not require food nor mental ideas. They just open their eyes after their deep meditation and see the world. The very opening of their eyes and few breathes are sufficient to nourish them for long hours in their functioning. The process of digestion takes only a few seconds and all their intake is converted into pure energy and very little is thrown out as a waste. Such great Yogis are like receptors and reflective mirrors. The human body for such perceptive and evolving souls is not a burden or a hindrance but a valuable means, a microscopic laboratory for the exploration of human consciousness and for trans-human states".\r\n\r\n"All these transpersonal journeys and ways of absorbing energy require a certain aloneness, in uncontaminated space and the need to be truly ''untouchable''. An alone and self-withdrawn soul is beyond human desires and conflict".\r\n\r\n"This ''new medium'' of the body, freed from the ''Past Karma'' and from the negative mental states like anxiety, fear and violence does not get clouded or fog the personal adventure. With this human body, we still have to make many experiments for evolving a brand new body for stabilising the ''New Consciousness". This is a heroic work and needs to be done with the objectivity and patience of a scientist and with the courage of a great warrior. You are now assigned a big task but remember that life never asks you to do anything beyond your capacities and limits. As one grows on the scale of evolution, one is required to face new and complex challenges".\r\n\r\n"If you have the will to go to the end, what you acquire is really beyond any measure. For this great work of transformation, the traditional forms of spiritual practices though useful in the past, are now inadequate and outdated. An experimental and operational approach to the spiritual world is needed. We have to encourage qualities like vision, imagination, objectivity, hard work and courage for our re-entry into the Other World of Triple Consciousness".\r\n\r\n"In the triple consciousness, while living within the every day known, you are also allowing the unknown to come into your life. The Yogi through Compassion, Charity and Creativity is constantly creating a body of ''Good Deeds''- ''Punya'' and establishing a moral order. He is free to create and equally free to negate what he has created. He is creating and negating and fulfilling the roles of Bramha,the creator, Vishnu, the preserver and Shiva, the destroyer. The spirit of Lord Dattatraya, the holy trinity should be understood as the sustainer of all life. The art of manifesting and the art of emptying are complementary for this evolutionary process. The emergence of triple consciousness is the next step in our growth and the tradition of the great ''Nath-Yogis'' demonstrate that what was possible for the few souls is equally possible now for the humankind. For this to happen, we need a new type of education and a corporate body of spiritual souls working together. The task before us is to wipe out the old memories of disease , defeat and death and affirm the divine qualities of Joy and Peace. Now it is not a question of human aspiration alone but we are assigned the work-of transforming the Planet Earth and supporting the self-organizing Universe".\r\n\r\nOur dialogue went on for a few hours.

They are high spiritual energy fields with the Divine power to transform the lives of people who go there with faith and devotion.\r\n\r\n<strong>Lord Dattatreya</strong>\r\nHindu Mythology represents Dattatraya as a Being with three faces, one of God Bramha, the other of God Vishnu and the third of Divine Shiva. The three heads represent the power of creation, preservation and destruction, which are present in the universe emanating from one and the same Reality, although each function is designated differently.\r\n\r\nThe trinity (trimurti) arising from a unity indicates the synthetic vision of the unity of things which has given life to Indian Philosophy down the ages. The four dogs at the feet of Lord Dattatraya represent the four Vedas as hounds of heaven and watch-dogs of truth, owned by Dattatray, the great Hunter for the souls of men. The ochre colored garb of Dattatraya symbolizes sanyasa, the spirit of renunciation or detachment without which realization of ultimate truth would only be a half-hearted effort.\r\n\r\nDattatraya the teacher and the Deity , I meditate on Him, the Lord, the ever-holy Lord , His hymn and his song too Do I expound by his irresistible glance?\r\n\r\nDattatraya is a teacher of Gods and of the antigods. He protects men from evil influences. He is worshipped by many sages and taught the Vedanta doctrine of self-realization. He is a person of gentle, peaceful and loving character. His Jayanti (Birthday) is celebrated on the full-moon in the month of Margasirsha (December).\r\n\r\nOne can experience this unique feeling in all his Ashrams &amp; Penance spot.\r\n\r\n<strong>Lord Shiva</strong>\r\nShiva is one of the Gods of the Trinity. Lord Shiva sits in a meditative pose against the white background of the snow-capped Himalayas in Mount Kailas. His posture symbolizes perfect inner harmony and poise, experienced by a man of Realization. He is noted in God-Consciousness. Nothing disturbs him. Lord Shiva not only represents the supreme state of perfection in man but in his very pose indicates the way to reach it as well. He is also a great ascetic and the patron duty of ascetics generally.\r\n\r\nHe is said to be the God of destruction. He stays in horrible places such as battlefield, burning-grounds and crossroads, which destroys all them. Shiva is said to have a third eye known as an eye of wisdom-whose vision reaches beyond the physical to divine vision of reality.\r\n\r\nShiva is married to the Goddess Uma who represents the whole nature which is perishable matter. Shiva?s marriage with Uma signifies that human nature could rise above and transform itself into Divine Shiva (Blessed Nature)\r\n\r\n<strong>The Nine Masters</strong>\r\nThe Nath-sect occupies an important position in the religions history of medieval India. It is a popular all-India religious movement that strives for immortality by transforming the human body into an imperishable divine body.\r\n\r\nThe aim of a yogi is to become a Nath, meaning ‘Master’. He must undergo a systematic course of moral, physical, intellectual and spiritual discipline with a view to the attainment of perfect mastery over body and the Trinity Nature. A Yogi must rise above all bondages, sorrows and limitations and all the weaknesses of his physical and psychic nature. He should conquer death. He must acquire ‘Darshan’, a true vision that is to say, perfect insight into the ultimate character of reading.\r\n\r\nThe Nath Yogis are Nine traditional Masters - all have transformed their bodies through yogic discipline who reside in Himalayas. Adinath as Lord Shiva is their Guru and Matsyendranath is considered the first of the human gurus (spiritual guides). The credit of placing Nath-tradition on a firm foundation is given to Sri Gorakfhnath who had combined the philosophy of Shiva with the Hathayoga of Patanjali on the practical side. The Nath Yogies achieve a state of natural harmony through cultivation of the culture of body (Kaya - Sadhana) by the control of semen, breath and thought. Guidance of an accomplished Guru (teacher) is considered essential.

The first day of the NEW YEAR. Financial year is over, balance sheets are completed at various places by reviewing and comparing income and expenditure of previous year to that of present year and budget is planned for the next year. This is regarding finance.\r\n\r\nNow we will analyse our own nature. What good habits/ qualities we have adopted this year and what bad habits/qualities we have given up has to be reviewed. Whether our personality is developed or there is no change or whether it has gone bad that we will study now.\r\n\r\nThe qualities which will make our life perfect and fully developed are confidence, determination, self-control, fearlessness, happiness and thoughtfulness. Now we will see which of these qualities are already possessed by us and which qualities we have acquired now. We become happy when we see the balance left with us at the end of the year. The same degree of happiness overcomes us when we find that we have conquered over bad qualities by developing new habits and qualities among ourselves.\r\n\r\nWe know what is good and also know what is bad. By experience we learn that if we intend to do something we can do it. And therefore we must always determine to do good only.\r\n\r\nAs the age, power and status of the man rise his behaviour is expected to be more polished and well-mannered. We must understand that if we are four steps ahead this year, of last year then it is binding upon us to go further four steps ahead next year. Andif we have lagged (fallen) behind by four steps last year then we should be prepared to move eight steps ahead by finding out the reasons of lagging behind. When we become critic, then only we can evaluate ourselves and notice our faults which can be rectified by us in future. To conclude, when we are alone to ourselves, we should go through the diary of balance of income and expenditure of day today life."', 'BALANCE SHEET OF HUMAN NATURE', 0, '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '105-revision-2', '', '', '2009-06-04 09:51:23', '2009-06-04 09:51:23', '', 105, 'http://www.gagangiriv1.com/105-revision-2/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),

Now we will see which of these qualities are already possessed by us and which qualities we have acquired now. We become happy when we see the balance left with us at the end of the year. The same degree of happiness overcomes us when we find that we have conquered over bad qualities by developing new habits and qualities among ourselves.\r\n\r\nWe know what is good and also know what is bad.

And therefore we must always determine to do good only.\r\n\r\nAs the age, power and status of the man rise his behaviour is expected to be more polished and well-mannered. We must understand that if we are four steps ahead this year, of last year then it is binding upon us to go further four steps ahead next year. Andif we have lagged (fallen) behind by four steps last year then we should be prepared to move eight steps ahead by finding out the reasons of lagging behind.

The growing crisis entraps the life of the common man, whose needs continue to increase, making the problem more and more acute. Roughing it up against all these odds with courage and a firm stand will resolve some challenges. But basically an attitude of self-reliance and cooperation is needed to counter this negative environment. Acceptance of the commitments and challenges in one''s life with poise and an open attitude is the first threshold of spiritual life."\r\n\r\nWhen you come to this mountain, I appeal to you to shift your attitude. A shift from the pursuit of need fulfillment and personal problems towards the quest for knowledge and wisdom. There is the fundamental difference in the life of a Yogi and other human beings. The common man is perpetually dependent. He is ignorant and unsure of his capabilities. He has not developed the ability to use his creative intelligence. He lives on borrowed knowledge. How long can you pull-on with a borrowed existence ? On the other hand, a Yogi is autonomous. He is self contained and complete."\r\n\r\n"In all these years of your pilgrimage to Gagangad, the Immense Power within these hills has barely touched anyone - Living on this mountain demands a rare courage.

This mountain breathes ! It radiates tremendous energy. This Power can absorb and engulf any human suffering or sorrow. My life has been ever renewed by it, making me respond moment to moment.\r\n\r\nHuman senses and intellect undergo a mutation through an association with this Immensity. Now my body does not have an existence by itself. It has developed a strong permanent bond with this Power. The Power has taught me devotion. It has taught me to assume responsibility and action for the world."\r\n\r\n"With Divine grace, we have embarked upon an odyssey. We must act, with commitment, faith and devotion.

Gagangiri Maharaj was sitting in the meditative posture in his cottage. After my initial talk with him, Maharaj expressed that he would now prefer to sit in the stream. We moved out and entered the flowing water. He pointed out a place for me to sit near him, and for a few minutes he took a dip in the water.\r\n\r\nAfter some time, Ashish came with tea. He is a young graduate who is spending the last five or six months in the company of Maharaj, serving him. Maharaj looked at him and said, "Because of such a close contact with me, Ashish has now observed, many things about me. He would tell you about my body purification processes and the art of absorbing energy from nature. This process transforms one''s body. Ashish has personally seen how the transformation of energy brings luster and when I am surrounded by people and crowds, energy gets lost".\r\n\r\nI felt very happy because Maharaj had opened a topic about which I wanted to know more from him. He too was very enthusiastic, giving details about the art of absorbing energy, Maharaj was referring to the fifth stage of Patanjali Yoga. There are eight aspects of Yoga according to Patanjali. The first four steps ''Yam'', ''Niyam'',''Asan'',''Pranayam'' are like laying down the foundation, but the next four steps are advanced stages for doing meditation.\r\n\r\n''Pratyahar'' is the art of withdrawal of the senses. The fifth stage is only possible when you have the right attitude and have purified your mind and body. The later stages of meditation are ''Dharana'', ''Dhyana'', and ''Samadhi''. Maharaj stood up and said that his body is like a shield protecting him from any human pollution and temptations. He continued the subject.\r\n\r\n"We have to master skillfully, the technique of withdrawal of the senses from the sense objects. The external world is always pressurizing us with stimuli but as conscious humans we have to develop our choice of alternatives and willpower. We should act and not react to these external challenges. Many people, I see, have not mastered the art of ''Pratyahar, and they react and get caught in the net of their negative feelings. ''Pratyahar'' is the real beginning of Yoga and the one who has learnt ''I this art is the master and not a victim in any situation or environment. Such withdrawal of senses, stops the wastage of energy. Energy is preserved now for developing one pointed concentration. ''Dharana'' and ''Dhyana'' are the stages of such meditative awareness and mindfulness. Later it takes us to the height of ''Samadhi''. So ''Pratyahar'' is a significant step, the turning point, in one''s development. Look at my body ! It is hard like metal and it is also delicate like a flower in facing the external challenges and situations. But I am always able to master a situation and ''Pratyahar'' is my secret".\r\n\r\nMaharaj was very communicative and eager to convey some of his esoteric insights. He continued,\r\n"I would like to tell you more about the ''Navanaths'', And other great yogis who stay in the mountains. They live on pure air and do not require any solid food. They are alone. They do not depend on human beings or on any external things and are self-reliant and autonomous to the highest degree. Such rare groups of Yogis have preserved our spiritual culture. Even today, our esoteric tradition is kept alive because of them. Their presence radiates the eternal Vedantic truths. It is not book knowledge or somebody''s report or a mere belief or an inference. I see their very presence catalyzing the growth of other evolving souls ''The second level of work is the purification of the body and cleansing of impure, solidified sensations. The heaviness and inertia of the body is reduced and it becomes very light like a feather. A purified body is like a fine instrument for knowing oneself, for knowing the world, and contacting the Divine. Such triple consciousness can lead us to another level of reality".\r\n\r\n"in the triple mode of consciousness, the Yogi is first aware of his own body-mind system and observes from moment to moment the complex inward processes which are happening inside him. Secondly as he is not a closed being, he is also listening attentively to the world and to the people. He is aware of their individual and collective problems. With a sense of objectivity and detachment coupled with involvement and participation, he can find out relevant solutions to their problems.\r\n\r\nThirdly his uniqueness lies in being aware of the dynamic potentiality of the Other World : the Divine World of Peace, Compassion and Beauty. Through his meditative awareness, he is praying on behalf of the many for bringing Grace and Happiness to all. The normal human world is a world full of problems and sufferings. The many artificial boundaries we draw for our safety, enclose us and we are stuck and doomed forever unless the Other World intervenes for our redemption. The Other World is the Unknown and Mystery. It is the inexhaustible. power ruling the universe". "The great task of the Yogi is not only the act of balance, but practicing the art of synthesis of the three modes of consciousness. The state of Triple Consciousness empowers him to play the roles of a friend, a healer, a teacher and the facilitator for a global transformation. For him the terms like life / death have lost their outer meanings. Life and death are not opposing categories but complementaries for any growth. So, what is generally called as life by others is a state of dying to him and what is commonly understood as death by many is an opportunity for the renewal of real life to him. Death is the Greatest Guru of all, teaching the lessons of negation and compassionate affirmation. The Yogi is a traveler between the worlds to life and death and frequently and leisurely camping and scouting in the intermediate, twilight zone of consciousness for nourishment and creativity. The canvas of his life now covers the Whole Time - the past, the present and the future. There is no tomorrow, but only Now".\r\n\r\n"Because of old religious prejudices, for centuries we have looked down and condemned the physical body as an enemy, and as a heavy liability. We have neglected the growth of the potential which is in us. The body as it is now is pampered and misused. True, the body with it''s unruly desires and passions has posed problems. But the same body if taken into confidence and spoken to, could be developed as a sensitive instrument for the holistic growth. In fact the ''Hatha'' and ''Tantra'' Yogas know and utilise the body with it''s passions as an asset and sublimate these energies for spiritual powers and siddhis. A purified body is a new vehicle for unknown energy paths".\r\n\r\n"The work is not merely purifying the body but becoming a refined instrument to receive energy from everything.\r\n\r\nNow the third level is to enter the energy field. Every object radiates some energy. Group of objects create fields of energies. Objects are radiating positive and negative energies. The purified mind is capable of receiving energies through new sensations. A great Yogi ''eats'' and ''devours'' such energy and that is why I said earlier that he doesn''t require solid food. I can point out a few examples. See that blooming yellow flower; it is giving me energy. Observe that light on the greenish water; it is sparkling with energy. See that bird on the wing; it conveys another subtle energy. The whole green foliage around the Ashram is giving me abundant energy. Look at those red bricks, I feel their baked hot energy.\r\n\r\nSince I am able to absorb such energies, subtle bodily and physiolgical changes are taking place in me. Ashish has noticed how the colour of my hair changes from black to gray and some times it turns into gold". While listening to him today, I felt a clarity about a new mode of perception which we could experiment and try. Why not ? But I was questioning how this could be possible not only with Maharaj, but also with a seeking few.\r\n\r\n"What I say is also the experience of great Rishis. Even the Buddhist Monks and the Jain Sadhus speak about the same level of reality. Sensitive souls get nourished by such energy processes and their brains do not operate on mere ideas and inference. Food is a very small item in terms of energy to them. For a normal person, when he takes food, it require six to eight hours for its conversion into blood and the rest is thrown out as waste. But the great Yogis do not require food nor mental ideas. They just open their eyes after their deep meditation and see the world. The very opening of their eyes and few breathes are sufficient to nourish them for long hours in their functioning. The process of digestion takes only a few seconds and all their intake is converted into pure energy and very little is thrown out as a waste. Such great Yogis are like receptors and reflective mirrors. The human body for such perceptive and evolving souls is not a burden or a hindrance but a valuable means, a microscopic laboratory for the exploration of human consciousness and for trans-human states".\r\n\r\n"All these transpersonal journeys and ways of absorbing energy require a certain aloneness, in uncontaminated space and the need to be truly ''untouchable''. An alone and self-withdrawn soul is beyond human desires and conflict".\r\n\r\n"This ''new medium'' of the body, freed from the ''Past Karma'' and from the negative mental states like anxiety, fear and violence does not get clouded or fog the personal adventure. With this human body, we still have to make many experiments for evolving a brand new body for stabilising the ''New Consciousness". This is a heroic work and needs to be done with the objectivity and patience of a scientist and with the courage of a great warrior. You are now assigned a big task but remember that life never asks you to do anything beyond your capacities and limits. As one grows on the scale of evolution, one is required to face new and complex challenges".\r\n\r\n"If you have the will to go to the end, what you acquire is really beyond any measure. For this great work of transformation, the traditional forms of spiritual practices though useful in the past, are now inadequate and outdated. An experimental and operational approach to the spiritual world is needed. We have to encourage qualities like vision, imagination, objectivity, hard work and courage for our re-entry into the Other World of Triple Consciousness".\r\n\r\n"In the triple consciousness, while living within the every day known, you are also allowing the unknown to come into your life. The Yogi through Compassion, Charity and Creativity is constantly creating a body of ''Good Deeds''- ''Punya'' and establishing a moral order. He is free to create and equally free to negate what he has created. He is creating and negating and fulfilling the roles of Bramha,the creator, Vishnu, the preserver and Shiva, the destroyer. The spirit of Lord Dattatraya, the holy trinity should be understood as the sustainer of all life. The art of manifesting and the art of emptying are complementary for this evolutionary process. The emergence of triple consciousness is the next step in our growth and the tradition of the great ''Nath-Yogis'' demonstrate that what was possible for the few souls is equally possible now for the humankind. For this to happen, we need a new type of education and a corporate body of spiritual souls working together. The task before us is to wipe out the old memories of disease , defeat and death and affirm the divine qualities of Joy and Peace. Now it is not a question of human aspiration alone but we are assigned the work-of transforming the Planet Earth and supporting the self-organizing Universe".\r\n\r\nOur dialogue went on for a few hours. It was a blessing to ''listen to him, so quitely and intensely.

They are high spiritual energy fields with the Divine power to transform the lives of people who go there with faith and devotion.\r\n\r\n<strong>Lord Dattatreya</strong>\r\nHindu Mythology represents Dattatraya as a Being with three faces, one of God Bramha, the other of God Vishnu and the third of Divine Shiva. The three heads represent the power of creation, preservation and destruction, which are present in the universe emanating from one and the same Reality, although each function is designated differently.\r\n\r\nThe trinity (trimurti) arising from a unity indicates the synthetic vision of the unity of things which has given life to Indian Philosophy down the ages. The four dogs at the feet of Lord Dattatraya represent the four Vedas as hounds of heaven and watch-dogs of truth, owned by Dattatray, the great Hunter for the souls of men. The ochre colored garb of Dattatraya symbolizes sanyasa, the spirit of renunciation or detachment without which realization of ultimate truth would only be a half-hearted effort.\r\n\r\nDattatraya the teacher and the Deity , I meditate on Him, the Lord, the ever-holy Lord , His hymn and his song too Do I expound by his irresistible glance?\r\n\r\nDattatraya is a teacher of Gods and of the antigods. He protects men from evil influences. He is worshipped by many sages and taught the Vedanta doctrine of self-realization. He is a person of gentle, peaceful and loving character. His Jayanti (Birthday) is celebrated on the full-moon in the month of Margasirsha (December).\r\n\r\nOne can experience this unique feeling in all his Ashrams &amp; Penance spot.\r\n\r\n<strong>Lord Shiva</strong>\r\nShiva is one of the Gods of the Trinity. Lord Shiva sits in a meditative pose against the white background of the snow-capped Himalayas in Mount Kailas. His posture symbolizes perfect inner harmony and poise, experienced by a man of Realization. He is noted in God-Consciousness. Nothing disturbs him. Lord Shiva not only represents the supreme state of perfection in man but in his very pose indicates the way to reach it as well. He is also a great ascetic and the patron duty of ascetics generally.\r\n\r\nHe is said to be the God of destruction. He stays in horrible places such as battlefield, burning-grounds and crossroads, which destroys all them. Shiva is said to have a third eye known as an eye of wisdom-whose vision reaches beyond the physical to divine vision of reality.\r\n\r\nShiva is married to the Goddess Uma who represents the whole nature which is perishable matter. Shiva?s marriage with Uma signifies that human nature could rise above and transform itself into Divine Shiva (Blessed Nature)\r\n\r\n<strong>The Nine Masters</strong>\r\nThe Nath-sect occupies an important position in the religions history of medieval India. It is a popular all-India religious movement that strives for immortality by transforming the human body into an imperishable divine body.\r\n\r\nThe aim of a yogi is to become a Nath, meaning ‘Master’. He must undergo a systematic course of moral, physical, intellectual and spiritual discipline with a view to the attainment of perfect mastery over body and the Trinity Nature. A Yogi must rise above all bondages, sorrows and limitations and all the weaknesses of his physical and psychic nature. He should conquer death. He must acquire ‘Darshan’, a true vision that is to say, perfect insight into the ultimate character of reading.\r\n\r\nThe Nath Yogis are Nine traditional Masters - all have transformed their bodies through yogic discipline who reside in Himalayas. Adinath as Lord Shiva is their Guru and Matsyendranath is considered the first of the human gurus (spiritual guides). The credit of placing Nath-tradition on a firm foundation is given to Sri Gorakfhnath who had combined the philosophy of Shiva with the Hathayoga of Patanjali on the practical side. The Nath Yogies achieve a state of natural harmony through cultivation of the culture of body (Kaya - Sadhana) by the control of semen, breath and thought. Guidance of an accomplished Guru (teacher) is considered essential. Sri Gagangiri is a Nath Yogi in this tradition.\r\n\r\n<strong>Rishi Culture</strong>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Sage amidst Mountains and caves</li>\r\n	<li>Model of Rishi culture</li>\r\n	<li>Manifestation of Knowledge</li>\r\n	<li>Realisation</li>\r\n	<li>Self-Realisation</li>\r\n	<li>Self-Realisation of the body</li>\r\n	<li>Knowledge about self</li>\r\n	<li>Self Knowledge</li>\r\n	<li>Strength of Mind</li>\r\n	<li>The perception of Soul.</li>\r\n	<li>Current of Thoughts</li>\r\n	<li>Personal Bhakti Marg - The way of devotion</li>\r\n	<li>The penance without desires</li>\r\n	<li>Self-less penance</li>\r\n	<li>Penance for Happiness</li>\r\n	<li>The process of understanding penance</li>\r\n	<li>and knowledge</li>\r\n	<li>Knowledge of the Kundalini</li>\r\n	<li>The Great Experience Of Penance</li>\r\n	<li>Yoga based coordination process of Aryas</li>\r\n</ul>', 'MYTHOLOGY AND GANGANGIRI MAHARAJ', 0, '', 'inherit', 'open', 'open', '', '124-revision-2', '', '', '2009-06-04 10:05:51', '2009-06-04 10:05:51', '', 124, 'http://www.gagangiriv1.com/124-revision-2/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),
